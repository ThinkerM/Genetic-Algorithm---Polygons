# Genetic-Algorithm---Polygons
Implementation of a genetic algorithm, generic support for various domains, 
currently support for polygons (using their axial symmetry as a fitness function).

Main program components:
  - Genetic Algorithm
    . Adjust genetic algorithm parameters, choose different fitness function calculators, run genetic algorithm
  - Population Manager
    . Manage multiple polygons at once (automatic generation, saving, loading)
  - Shape Creator
    . Define polygon shapes, colors, names
    
To create a new domain, the following needs to be implemented:
